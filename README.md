Server Side - Efosa Asemota





# Instructions
	As a member of the repository. You will need to clone a local instance of EfosaA/Chat-Server repository to your local machine. There are no additional files that need to be loaded for dependencies. You will then open up your machines terminal with multiple windows. The maximum number of clients is currently set to 4. You must navigate from your current directory to the folder location of the cloned documents. After doing this action in each of the terminal windows, you are to launch the ServerNew.py files by using the python ./ServerNew.py command. This will set up a server for clients to connect to and send messages. Next, you are to run the command: python ./ClientNew.py in each of the terminal windows in order to have a client connect to the server. The Client will then prompt you to send a message and you will see it appear on the server side which will allow you to respond back.This is the implementation of our server client chat room. Our test case is the system should stop running if the client recives a message of “Bye”.
